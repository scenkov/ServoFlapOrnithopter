# ESP32 board and SBUS receiver 
Thanks to K.Kakuta for the enormous work

Arduino CODE for ServoFlapOrnithopter [ServoFlapOrnithopter 2 servo by K.Kakuta](http://kakutaclinic.life.coocan.jp/SFOsys2S.html)

The library uses [ESP32Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/esp32servo/) Allows ESP32 boards to control servo, tone and analogWrite motors using Arduino semantics.
This library can control a many types of servos. It makes use of the ESP32 PWM timers: the library can control up to 16 servos on individual channels No attempt has been made to support multiple servos per channel.
